            concept: "In Falling Leaves Return to Roots, Zihan Teng interweaves personal memory, biological processes, and spatial experience into an installation that resists a fixed or finished state.<br><br>Rather than presenting a stable object, the exhibition unfolds as an ongoing process—an open field for reflection on time, decay, circulation, and return.<br><br>At the core of the work are ginkgo leaves. The ginkgo, a plant that has survived across geological epochs, functions here not merely as a natural motif or symbol, but as a carrier of time itself.<br>Through the accumulation, oxidation, discoloration, decomposition, and gradual disappearance of the leaves, the irreversible nature of biological processes is inscribed directly into the exhibition space.<br>Change, rather than form, becomes the artwork.<br><br>The work originates from the artist’s memory of his late grandfather, a botanist and ginkgo researcher.<br>Yet this biographical reference is not presented narratively; instead, it is translated into a working method.<br>The logic of plant life replaces an anthropocentric mode of storytelling.<br>The withering of the leaves does not signal an end, but a transition—from leaf to powder, from powder to nutrient, from disappearance to renewal.<br>Death is understood here as a transformation of matter and energy.<br><br>The exhibition space itself becomes a breathing system.<br>Humidity, air circulation, time, and chance actively participate in the formation of the work.<br>By consciously relinquishing control, the artist allows natural forces to become co-authors of the installation.<br>This gesture challenges conventional expectations of stability and preservation within exhibition contexts, while positioning the work within contemporary discourses on process aesthetics, non-human agency, and ecological ethics.<br><br>Falling Leaves Return to Roots does not seek to provide definitive answers.<br>Instead, it invites visitors into a heightened state of perception: to sense the weight of time beneath their feet and to recognize their own bodies as part of the same cycle.<br>The return to “roots” is not an act of nostalgia or retreat into the past, but an acknowledgment of a fundamental structure of life—one in which all emergence depends on decay, and every beginning is nourished by an ending.<br>This is a work about letting go: about coexisting with uncertainty and continuing to grow through loss.<br>In its quiet persistence, it poses a profound question—what new forms of art and life might emerge when we stop attempting to control time and begin to move with it?",

            intro: "2025 <br> Glue, wall powder, net<br>approx.695x392x320cm <br> exhibition view “Diplom 2025”,AdBK.Munich",
            concept: "In The Dissolution of Eternity, architecture is no longer presented as a stable or inhabitable structure, but is instead reconfigured as a fragile and uncertain condition.<br><br>By employing suspension, blur, and spatial ambiguity, Zihan Teng transforms architecture into both the subject and the medium of an immersive environment that exists between reality and nothingness.<br>As viewers enter the installation, they encounter a space devoid of material certainty: light and shadow remain in constant flux, forms gradually lose their clarity, and architecture relinquishes its traditional role as a symbol of permanence, emerging instead as a transient and illusory presence.<br><br>The entire structure is suspended in the air, while a passage remains between the wall and the constructed space.<br>This in-between zone allows those outside to look inward and those inside to glimpse the exterior, disrupting the conventional boundary between interior and exterior.<br>Viewers are never fully enclosed, nor fully detached. By constantly shifting positions—inside and outside, observer and participant—the audience experiences architecture not as shelter or monument, but as a dissolving condition of perception.<br><br>Conceptually, Teng treats architecture as one of the most authoritative symbols of human civilization.<br>Buildings traditionally embody order, memory, power, and the aspiration toward permanence.<br>In this work, however, architecture is dismembered and deconstructed, stripped of its functional and commemorative roles.<br>What remains are unstable outlines and fading structures, suggesting that disappearance is not an eventual outcome but an intrinsic state.<br>Rather than depicting ruins as the aftermath of time, the artist presents a building already vanishing at the moment of its existence.<br><br>This approach reflects a deeper anxiety embedded in contemporary society.<br>The values, meanings, and symbolic systems constructed by humanity often appear solid and enduring, yet they may be as vulnerable as finely crafted sculptures slowly eroded by time.<br>In the vast temporal scale of eternity, all structures—physical and ideological—inevitably lose their form.<br>Teng’s work does not dramatize collapse through spectacle; instead, it reveals a quiet, irreversible process of dissolution.<br><br>Importantly, The Dissolution of Eternity does not offer a definitive conclusion.<br>It neither declares the death of meaning nor proposes a new mythology of permanence.<br>Instead, it places the viewer in a suspended, contemplative state.<br>As one wanders through the installation, a fundamental question emerges: if all systems of meaning and all architectural forms are destined to disappear, does the eternity we strive for truly exist?",

            concept: "“The ashes, the lightest of the ruins, can be completely destroyed by a gust of wind.”<br><br>In this body of work, Zihan Teng uses ashes as a central material and metaphor, covering flags, chairs, cushions, branches, and boxes to construct a quiet, enclosed, and meditative space.<br>Stripped of their original functions, these objects evoke a distant and lifeless world, where absence becomes a dominant presence.<br>The uniform layer of ash dissolves distinctions between the symbolic and the ordinary, inviting viewers into a suspended state of reflection.<br><br>Among the ash-covered objects are both references to nationalism and war, as well as everyday items associated with the artist’s childhood.<br>In Let Us March Towards the Ashes!, ashen flags appear as fragile residues of contemporary nationalism and its violent consequences.<br>History is present not through spectacle or declaration, but through aftermath—reduced to delicate remains that resist ideological fixation.<br><br>In contrast, works such as KISSEN turn toward intimacy and personal memory.<br>Cushions, associated with comfort and rest, carry traces of nostalgia and emotional closeness.<br>Yet this introspective approach does not lead to isolation. For Teng, intimacy is not synonymous with withdrawal;<br>by looking inward, the artist opens a path toward the future.<br>Within the ashes, warmth, tenderness, and hope become more precious, and the viewer is drawn into a subtle sense of lightness that retains depth.",

            concept: "This project proposes an aerial space in which photosynthesis can occur—a structure suspended in the air that gradually shifts in color, turning yellow and gray over time.<br>Light is not merely an external condition of the work, but its essential driving force: absorbed, transformed, and quietly consumed by living matter.<br><br>The project is inspired by the memory of the artist’s late grandfather, a botanist who devoted his life to the study of the ginkgo.<br>This suspended space becomes a metaphor for what he pursued throughout his lifetime—something illusory and fragile, yet deeply infused with life.<br>Existing between presence and disappearance, the work embodies a form of devotion that does not seek permanence, but continuity through light.<br><br>By bringing light into the space and allowing it to be slowly absorbed, the work reflects on photosynthesis as both a biological process and a poetic act: light transformed into life, time made visible through gradual change.<br>As the structure ages and its colors fade, it echoes the inevitable passage of time and the quiet persistence of memory.<br><br>The project ultimately asks a fundamental question: what do we pursue in life, and will it leave a trace in this world?<br>Perhaps what we seek does not remain as a solid form, but becomes dust—continuing to absorb light, lingering invisibly in the air.",

            concept: "In “Riss”, Zihan Teng constructs a spatial process in which light, material, and action unfold over time.<br>The exhibition space is initially immersed in violet light emitted from three UV tubes suspended from the ceiling, each wrapped in paper.<br>These luminous elements find a formal correspondence in three cuts chiseled into the floor directly beneath them, establishing a vertical axis between above and below.<br><br>At the opening of the exhibition, the artist cuts open the paper coverings around the lights.<br>The powder stored within begins to fall, drifting slowly through the air and settling into the cracks in the floor.<br>Light emerges from the fissures in the ceiling and descends into the fissures below, completing a quiet but precise cycle.<br>What occurs is not an image, but a process—an event that exists only through time, gravity, and presence.<br><br>At the end of the exhibition, the space is returned to its original state.<br>The loose material is buried back into the floor, and all visible traces of the action are removed.<br>What remains is no longer perceptible, yet not entirely absent.<br>Teng describes his intervention as “an insignificant crack,” a minimal gesture that resists spectacle while opening a space for fundamental experience.<br><br>Riss reflects on existence as a movement between birth and death, appearance and disappearance.<br>By refusing conventional modes of image-making, the work begins at a conceptual zero point, where light itself becomes the medium of transition.<br>The crack functions not as damage, but as passage—an opening through which viewers become aware of their own presence and temporality.<br>If nothing visible endures, what survives our actions? Teng suggests that something remains, even if it cannot be seen.<br>In Riss, light completes its journey from ceiling to floor, and in this fleeting alignment, an invisible residue of experience quietly persists.",

            concept: "For his works, Zihan Teng often makes use of everyday materials such as grease, ash, iron, soap, salt, concrete or glue, deliberately exposing them to different influences, such as light, wind, temperature changes, odours or sounds, over varying periods of time.<br>By doing so, he at times brings about a radical transformation in the material's appea-rance and texture, or even an almost complete disintegration or decay of the original object.<br><br>This is also the case in the artwork he created for the exhibition (Nach)Leben.<br>It is entitled 'It is there', which raises the question of what the “It” in question is and where it is to be found.<br>We recognize the shape of a chair, although it is apparent that it cannot fulfill its customary function as a piece of furniture: its frame strikes us as too fragile and its surface too cracked.<br>Not a stable, practical, and comfortable seating accommodation, but an ethereal-looking sculpture that merely references something that once existed but is no longer there.<br>In a narrow sense, it is a remnant of the former furniture itself, while in a broader sense, it can be seen as a nod to the human culture that produced it in the first place.",

Inspired by the memory of the artist’s late grandfather, a botanist and Ginkgo researcher, the project transforms the space into a fragile sphere where oxidation might occur – an illusory, living, yet transient environment.\n\nAt the center is the metaphor of falling leaves, which return to the ground in autumn, changing color, decaying, and disappearing. This creates a poetic reflection on impermanence, connection, and hope."

Zur Eröffnung der Ausstellung schneidet der Künstler die Papierummantelungen um die Leuchten auf, darin verwahrtes Pulver rieselt heraus und verteilt sich auf dem Boden. Zum Ausstellungsende setzt er den Ausstellungsraum in seinen ursprünglichen Zustand zurück, und vergräbt das lose Material im Boden.\n\nWas überdauert die Zeit, wenn von unseren Handlungen nichts Sichtbares übrigbleibt? „In dieser Zeit wurden unbedeutende Risse geschnitten“ schreibt Zihan Teng (*1998, China) zu seiner Arbeit. Er denkt über nichts weniger nach als den Ursprung unseren Seins und die Bewegungen zwischen Geburt und Tod. Er verweigert sich gängigen Weisen der Bilderzeugung, um an einem Nullpunkt anzusetzen. Zugleich sind es die von ihm eingesetzten Medien, die das erzeugen, was er als den Inhalt seiner Arbeiten ausweist – einen „Riss“ als Medium für eine elementare Erfahrungswelt, die die Betrachter*innen durch eine Erfahrung ihrer eigenen Präsenz in der Arbeit zu sich bringt."
